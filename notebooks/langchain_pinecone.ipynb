The passage also mentions the different schools of thought in strategy, including the prescriptive and descriptive schools, and raises questions about their relationship to each other in the strategic process.

Clausewitz states it as that everything in war is simple, but the simplest thing ios difficult. The difficulties in war are cumulate and in in producing a kind of friction. You can only experience friction unless you experienced a war. He describes friction as countless minor incidents which can lower the general level of performance. An example: You have a plan to attack something, but then you experience friction: little things go wrong and suddenly the roads are of terrible quality, they are worse then expected, or a supply that comes in late so soldiers are out of food and ammunition. Things that cant be foresee. This calls Clausewitz friction. If this is what you believe, what is the role of theory? Clausewitz thought that Theory should never be leading.
